# STM32G474RE Dual-Active-Bridge DC/DC Converter

This repository contains the firmware for a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC converter using the STM32G474RE microcontroller. The project implements the control and power management required for a high-power DAB converter.

## Directory Overview

| Directory  | Contents |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Core/`   | Main application sources generated by STM32CubeIDE, including startup code, HAL initialization, and user code. |
| `DPC_DAB/`| Digital power control library and application-specific configuration files for the DAB control algorithm. |
| `Drivers/`| CMSIS, STM32 HAL, and board support packages required to build the firmware. |

## Hardware Target

The project targets the **STM32G474RET6** MCU. This is defined in [`dab_stm32g474.ioc`](dab_stm32g474.ioc) where the line `Mcu.CPN=STM32G474RET6` specifies the exact part number.

## Building the Firmware

Use **STM32CubeIDE** to open the `.ioc` project file and generate the build environment. The linker scripts `STM32G474RETX_FLASH.ld` and `STM32G474RETX_RAM.ld` configure the memory layout for flash and RAM builds, respectively.

## Documentation

Additional documentation can be found in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.
